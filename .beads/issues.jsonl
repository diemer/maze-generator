Artifacts appear where vertical wall columns intersect row 24\n\n## Possible Causes:\n\n### A. Double-drawn strokes (if strokeWallCorners is disabled)\nWhen strokeWallCorners=false, each wall draws its entire top face outline. Adjacent walls share edges that get drawn twice, causing anti-aliasing artifacts.\n\nHowever, strokeWallCorners is CHECKED by default in index.html, so this may not be the issue.\n\n### B. Fill anti-aliasing at shared edges\nEven with selective stroke drawing, the top face FILL (solid color polygon) is drawn for every wall. Adjacent walls share edge vertices in their fill paths, which could cause canvas anti-aliasing artifacts.\n\n### C. Floating-point precision\nCertain (j+i) coordinate combinations might produce sub-pixel positions causing visible seams.\n\n## Debugging Steps:\n1. Toggle \"Wall corners only\" (strokeWallCorners) - does artifact change?\n2. Disable \"Show stroke\" entirely - does artifact disappear?\n3. Enable \"Debug stroke colors\" - which strokes appear at artifact locations?\n4. Disable floor textures - does artifact still appear?\n5.
